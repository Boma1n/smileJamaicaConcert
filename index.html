			<h5>Story</h5>
			<p>The Smile Jamaica concert is a historic concert held on December 5, 1976, at the National Heroes Park in Kingston, Jamaica, in which Bob Marley & the Wailers participated.</p>
			<p>Two days earlier, the singer was shot at his home on Hope Road. He survived his injuries. In spite of this, Marley had wanted to do this concert: while he had planned to perform only one song, he performed for an hour and a half in front of 80,000 spectators. All the Wailers were present, except for bassist Aston "Familyman" Barrett, who was replaced by Cat Coore from Third World.</p>
